if rendering math expressions fails in github use "obsidian" or "pandoc".

feel free to back up on vowi. i chose github because it's easier to collaborate on.

this repository had to be taken down during the ws25 term as a precaution. i had uploaded some of my exercise solutions before the submission deadline. unfortunately, this led to widespread plagiarism. some students copied my submissions word for word, including my name and matriculation number. as a result, i faced major point deductions and in some cases, even threats of legal action. but in the end, this project built more bridges than it burned. thank you! <3
